// This is the service the mobile clients use to talk to 'kik'.
//
// This service acts as the 'control plane' for clients to query the state of video chats (aka
// conferences) and join video chats within the context of a conversation. After requesting to join
// a video chat, this service provides connection information to the client so that they may connect
// to a media server to exchange video data. This service does NOT itself deal with video data directly.

service KikVideo {
    // This method allows clients to query the state of a video chat without joining it.
    //
    // Usage notes:
    //  -   Clients are expected to query the set of user visible conversations after the client connects.
    //  -   Clients MAY query this API after their initial connection but this SHOULD be unnecessary
    //      as updates will be pushed to the client via the mobileremote.video.v1.MobileVideo service
    rpc BatchedGetConvoState(BatchedGetConvoStateRequest) returns (BatchedGetConvoStateResponse);

    // Used by the client to start or join a video chat within the context of a specific conversation.
    //
    // If successful, this method changes the users state to connecting in the ConvoVideoState message.
    //  -   It WILL result in a MobileVideo (mobileremote) update for all the other users in the convo.
    //  -   It MAY result in a MobileVideo (mobileremote) update for the user requesting to join
    //
    // Once the client actually connects to the media server, they change state to be connected.
    //  -   This will result in a MobileVideo (mobileremote) update being sent to all clients in the
    //      conversation (including the user who is joining).
    //
    // Other notes:
    //  -   This method has 'get or create' semantics for a conference associated with a particular
    //      conversation.
    //  -   Clients MUST call this method prior to connecting to a media server
    //  -   This method returns connection information for the media server.
    //  -   This connection info is TRANSIENT and MUST be re-requested using this method if the client
    //      gets disconnected from the media server or is unable to connect.
    //  -   This method is expected to be idempotent. It is VALID to call this method multiple
    //      times. IE: this method SHOULD return a success even if the user requesting to join is
    //      already in the conference.

    // The timeout between a successful join request and the client actually connecting to the
    // media server is on the order of X.
